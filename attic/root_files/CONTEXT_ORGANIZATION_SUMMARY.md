- **Use Case**: When you need to write code that follows established patterns

### **4. System Architecture** (`04_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- **Purpose**: Understanding codebase structure and relationships
- **Content**: Project layout, component architecture, data flow, integration points
- **Use Case**: When you need to understand where code should go or how components interact

### **5. Next Session Plan** (`05_NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md`)
- **Purpose**: Planning immediate development work
- **Content**: Critical tasks, timeline, testing strategies, success metrics
- **Use Case**: When you need to plan development sessions or prioritize work

### **6. Context Guide** (`README.md`)
- **Purpose**: How to use context files effectively
- **Content**: Usage guidelines, prompting examples, maintenance instructions
- **Use Case**: When you need to understand how to leverage these context files

## 🔄 **How to Use Context Files**

### **For AI Prompting**
```
Context: I'm working on the trading system described in the context files.
I need to fix a memory leak in the composer integration (see 02_CRITICAL_ISSUES.md).
Please help me implement the solution following the development philosophy in 03_DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md.
```

### **For Development Planning**
```
Context: I'm planning the next development session for the trading system.
Please review the next session plan (05_NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md) and critical issues (02_CRITICAL_ISSUES.md)
to help me prioritize the work and estimate timelines.
```

### **For Code Reviews**
```
Context: I'm reviewing code changes for the trading system.
Please help me check if the changes follow the development philosophy (03_DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md)
and are consistent with the system architecture (04_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md).
```
