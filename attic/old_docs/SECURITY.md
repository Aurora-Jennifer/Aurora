# Security Policy

- Please **do not** file public issues for potential vulnerabilities.
- Email the maintainer (listed in CODEOWNERS) with details and PoC.
- No secrets (API keys, tokens) may appear in code, logs, or audits.
- CI runs static checks (Bandit, Gitleaks, pip-audit). High severity issues may be promoted to blocking at any time.
