# Root Tests Directory - Archived Test Files

## Files Moved
- `test_data_integrity.py` - Duplicate of tests/test_data_integrity.py (not referenced by pytest)
- `test_meaningful_validation.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `test_walkforward_ml.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `test_paper_engine.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `test_enhanced_trading_system.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `final_ml_validation.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `test_ml_backtesting.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `test_component_validation.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts
- `test_core_functionality.py` - Not referenced by pytest or other scripts

## Analysis
- These files were in the root directory but not discovered by pytest (which uses testpaths = tests)
- No imports or references found in active codebase
- Some files import each other but are not used by the main test suite
- Active test suite is in `tests/` directory

## Recovery
If any of these tests are needed:
1. Move to `tests/` directory
2. Update any imports to use relative paths
3. Ensure pytest can discover the tests
4. Update any config references if needed
