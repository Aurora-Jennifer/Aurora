# Attic Directory - Archived Files

This directory contains files that were moved during repository cleanup on 2025-08-15.

## Cleanup Details
- **Commit Hash:** 1db8cf9296248cab34d3526e1821b6761435e857
- **Reason:** Repository maintenance - removing unused files while preserving functionality
- **Method:** Safe cleanup - files moved to attic structure for potential recovery

## Directory Structure
- `root_tests/` - Test files that were in root directory but not referenced by pytest
- `config/` - Test configuration files only used by unused test files
- `docs/` - Obsolete documentation files superseded by newer documentation
- `attic_pending/` - Files requiring manual review before final decision

## Recovery Instructions
If any of these files are needed:
1. Check the specific .KEEP file in each subdirectory for details
2. Move the file back to its original location
3. Update any necessary imports or references
4. Remove the file from attic

## Validation
After cleanup, all tests in `tests/` directory should still pass:
```bash
pytest -q
```
