# Config Directory - Archived Test Configuration Files

## Files Moved
- `test_backtest_config.json` - Only used by test_core_functionality.py (archived)
- `test_paper_trading_config.json` - Only used by test_core_functionality.py (archived)
- `test_live_paper_trading_config.json` - Only used by scripts/test_live_paper_trading.py
- `test_performance_config.json` - Only used by test_core_functionality.py (archived)

## Analysis
- These config files were only referenced by test files that have been archived
- No active scripts or main application code references these configs
- Active configuration files remain in the main `config/` directory

## Recovery
If any of these configs are needed:
1. Move back to `config/` directory
2. Update any script references to use the correct path
3. Ensure the config format is compatible with current system
