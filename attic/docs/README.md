# Attic — Archived Documentation

Purpose: Keep legacy and historical documentation without cluttering active docs.

Policy:
- Sessions older than ~30 days are archived unless still active.
- Reports older than ~90 days or superseded are archived.
- Outdated guides/runbooks are archived when replaced.

If you need a document restored to active docs, open a PR referencing its attic path.
