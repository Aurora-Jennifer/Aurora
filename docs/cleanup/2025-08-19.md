## Findings refresh (2025-08-19T11:04:40-05:00)
- Reports: reports/vulture.txt, reports/deptry.json
- Quarantined files (7-day soak):
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/generate_ml_plots.py — superseded by scripts/multi_walkforward_report.py; only unused plotting imports; not referenced by CI/docs/tests.
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/guardrails.py — overlaps with core/risk/guardrails.py (authoritative); preventing drift/confusion.
