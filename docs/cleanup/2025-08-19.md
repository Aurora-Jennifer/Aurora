## Findings refresh (2025-08-19T11:04:40-05:00)
- Reports: reports/vulture.txt, reports/deptry.json
- Quarantined files (7-day soak):
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/generate_ml_plots.py — superseded by scripts/multi_walkforward_report.py; only unused plotting imports; not referenced by CI/docs/tests.
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/guardrails.py — overlaps with core/risk/guardrails.py (authoritative); preventing drift/confusion.

## Low-risk quarantine (2025-08-19T11:06:31-05:00)
- Reports: reports/vulture.txt, reports/deptry.json
- Quarantined (7-day soak):

  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/analyze_ml_learning.py — legacy ML learning analysis; not used by CI/smoke/tests.
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/test_ml_trading.py — legacy ML test harness; not part of pytest or smoke.
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/test_ml_recording.py — legacy recording harness; not part of pytest or smoke.
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/train_with_persistence.py — legacy ML training CLI; superseded by Alpha v1 flow.
  - attic/_quarantine_20250819/ml_walkforward.py — old ML walkforward; run_multi_asset_walkforward references its path; CI/smoke unaffected; will remove or replace after soak.
