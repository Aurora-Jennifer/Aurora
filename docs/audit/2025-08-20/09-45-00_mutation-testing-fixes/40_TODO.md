# TODO

## Immediate
- [ ] Monitor CI results to confirm mutation testing job passes
- [ ] Verify that all 13 metamorphic tests pass in CI environment

## Short-term
- [ ] Consider adding more edge case tests for DataSanity validation
- [ ] Review mutmut configuration for better mutation test coverage
- [ ] Add property-based tests using Hypothesis for more comprehensive data generation

## Medium-term
- [ ] Evaluate if metamorphic tests provide sufficient coverage vs. traditional unit tests
- [ ] Consider performance impact of mutation testing in CI
- [ ] Document best practices for writing metamorphic tests

## Long-term
- [ ] Explore integration with other testing frameworks (e.g., property-based testing)
- [ ] Consider automated test generation for DataSanity validation
- [ ] Evaluate mutation testing for other core modules beyond DataSanity
