# TODO / Follow-ups

## Immediate (Next Session)
- [ ] Fix mutmut configuration issues (TOML parsing, pytest integration)
- [ ] Monitor CI mutation testing job results
- [ ] Expand metamorphic test coverage for edge cases
- [ ] Add property-based testing with Hypothesis

## Short Term (Next Week)
- [ ] Optimize mutation testing performance for CI
- [ ] Add more sophisticated data corruption scenarios
- [ ] Create mutation testing dashboard/reporting
- [ ] Integrate with existing test quality metrics

## Medium Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Extend mutation testing to other core modules
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking for corrupted data validation
- [ ] Create automated mutation test generation
- [ ] Integrate with code coverage reporting

## Long Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Implement continuous mutation testing in development workflow
- [ ] Add mutation testing to release gates
- [ ] Create mutation testing best practices guide
- [ ] Explore advanced mutation testing techniques

## Notes
- Focus on DataSanity validation first, then expand scope
- Ensure mutation testing doesn't impact development velocity
- Consider integration with existing quality gates
- Monitor for false positives and adjust test sensitivity
