# Docs Prune — Roadmap (2025-08-21 03:25)

Purpose: Archive clearly outdated/unused docs to `attic/` while preserving content and adding pointers.

Scope (minimal):
- Move `docs/runbooks/alpha.md` (Alpha v1 runbook) → `attic/docs/runbooks/alpha_v1.md`.
- Move `docs/guides/# 🚀 Advanced Trading System with DataSa.md` (garbled legacy guide) → `attic/docs/guides/advanced_trading_system_with_datasanity_legacy.md`.

Success:
- Files moved; no content loss.
- Audit updated; EOD timeline includes entry.
